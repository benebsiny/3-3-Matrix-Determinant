#  3 × 3 Matrix Determinant
### What is it
The rule of Sarrus is a mnemonic for the 3 × 3 matrix determinant: the sum of the products of three diagonal north-west to south-east lines of matrix elements, minus the sum of the products of three diagonal south-west to north-east lines of elements, when the copies of the first two columns of the matrix are written beside it as in the illustration. This scheme for calculating the determinant of a 3 × 3 matrix does not carry over into higher dimensions.
### How to use it
After we clone it,we first have to put them in the same folder,then we can use any IDE,such as eclpse or IntelliJ IDEA etc,to build it.
Remember to change the coding to UTF-8,or it will display the garbled text.
### Benefit
It is easier to do our math homework.
